## Installation

1.  Fork and clone this repository.
2.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3.  Install yarn with `brew update brew install yarn`
4.  Run the front-end server with `yarn start`.

## Approach

My approach to this project was to go outside my comfor zone and build a full stack application while teaching myself a new technology. This was my first time building with a front end framework so I decided to use React.js. 

When I decided on a mad libs app, I started on the javascript logic to make the game actually work. When I finnally found the right way to do things the front end functionality came quickly. I didnt start running into problems until I got to the redirections and routeing. From there I leared alot about react and how its used. 

## Limitations

I was only limited by my lack of time. Although I did get stuck during the rotuing and clean urls part of the process I was able to work through the problems by reading the documentation and asking my fellow developers for help. 

## Future goals

I would like to be able to share funny libs among users and have users be able to comment on other users libs. I also defined some reach goals in my user stories.
